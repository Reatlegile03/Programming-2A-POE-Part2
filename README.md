To compile and run this C# program, you can follow these instructions:

Set up your development environment: Make sure you have a C# development environment installed. You can use Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code with the C# extension, or any other C# compiler.
Create a new C# project: Open your preferred development environment and create a new C# project. You can choose a console application project template.
Copy the code: Copy the provided C# code into the main file of your C# project. Typically, this file is named Program.cs.
Resolve dependencies: Ensure that you have access to the necessary dependencies. This code uses System and System.Collections.Generic, which are part of the .NET framework and should be available by default.
Compile the program: If you're using an IDE like Visual Studio, simply build the solution. If you're using the command line, navigate to the directory containing your project file (*.csproj) and run the appropriate build command for your compiler. For example, if you're using dotnet, you can run dotnet build.
Run the program: After successful compilation, you can run the program. If you're using an IDE, you can simply click on the "Run" button. If you're on the command line, navigate to the output directory (usually bin/Debug or bin/Release) and run the compiled executable. In this case, the program's entry point is the Main method in the Program class.
Interact with the program: Once the program is running, follow the on-screen prompts to interact with it. You can add recipes, display them, scale them, reset quantities, clear recipes, and exit the program as per the provided menu options.
Exit the program: When you're done using the program, select the option to exit. The program will terminate, and you'll return to the command line or IDE environment.
By following these steps, you should be able to compile and run the provided C# program successfully.
